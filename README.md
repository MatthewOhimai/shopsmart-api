## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   Move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd shopsmart
   ```

3. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
   Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**
   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configuration**
   Copy `.flaskenv` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .flaskenv .env
   ```
   Define the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file, such as `SECRET_KEY`, `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`, etc. Example for SQLite:
   ```env
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///database.db
   ```

6. **Database Migration Commands**
   - Initialize migration:
     ```bash
     flask db init
     ```
   - Generate a migration version:
     ```bash
     flask db migrate -m 'Initial migration'
     ```
   - Upgrade to apply the migrations to the database:
     ```bash
     flask db upgrade
     ```

7. **Running The Application**
